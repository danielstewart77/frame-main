# frame-main — minimal per-user agent-server

A single-box agent system: one FastAPI **agent-server** is the **control plane**.
It provisions a pristine container per session and runs the harness (`claude`,
`codex`, ...) inside it. One isolated workspace per user, surfaces (Telegram + web)
over HTTP. No custom agent loop. The harness *is* the agent.

## Principles

- **Wrap, don't rebuild.** `agent-server` only spawns `claude --resume`, streams
  json, and pipes IO. Turn loop, tools, edits, build-test-fix all live inside
  the harness.
- **Durable side effects, not durable process.** Resume replays the transcript,
  not in-flight work. Every turn commits and *pushes* to a per-user bare repo on
  the host, so work survives even when the container is thrown away. Idempotent
  operations make a replayed turn harmless.
- **Control plane owns Docker; the agent never does.** Only `agent-server` touches
  the Docker socket. It provisions one pristine container per session; the harness
  runs inside with no socket access. No docker-in-docker, no privilege leak, no
  agent spawning containers.
- **Isolated workspace per user.** Per-user memory, identity, and session lineage.
  The user id is a boundary, not just a filter.
- **The session is the unit, not the agent.** A session row carries its own
  harness, model, and pristine container. There is no long-lived "agent" object
  that owns sessions — the session *is* the agent instance for its lifetime.
  Spawn = a new row + container; ditch = status `archived` + container removed;
  return = resume. Both the ChatGPT-style sidebar and the fan-out-twelve desktop
  flow are just views over the same table.
- **Multi-user schema now, multi-user machinery later.** Every table carries
  `user_id` from day one. Login flows, quotas, and process isolation wait until a
  real second user exists.

```

Containers are ephemeral and pristine. Everything that must persist — git
history, memory, identity — lives on the host under `users/<user_id>/` and is
mounted (memory, identity) or pushed to (`origin.git`) from the container.

**Naming.** Component, file, and service names use hyphens, never underscores
(`agent-server`, `telegram-bot`, `stop-commit.sh`) — underscores are painful over
voice. Hyphenated `.py` files (`agent-server.py`) are **entrypoints run
directly** (`python agent-server.py`), never imported; importable logic lives in
single-word modules so no module name ever needs an underscore. SQL columns and
in-code identifiers (`user_id`, `session_id`) keep underscores — hyphens are
illegal there and they aren't spoken names.

## Registry schema (central)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,        -- uuid
  display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
  status       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active'
);

-- surface identity → user (a Telegram chat, a web login, etc.)
CREATE TABLE identities (
  surface      TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'telegram' | 'web'
  external_id  TEXT NOT NULL,           -- telegram chat_id, web user id
  user_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),
  PRIMARY KEY (surface, external_id)
);

-- one row per task/topic session; the session owns its harness + model + container
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,        -- our stable session uuid
  user_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),
  title        TEXT,                    -- topic/task label, editable
  color        TEXT,                    -- optional accent color for the frame + session list, editable
  harness      TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'claude' | 'codex' | ...
  model        TEXT NOT NULL,           -- e.g. 'opus'
  branch       TEXT NOT NULL,           -- git branch in origin.git for this session
  container_id TEXT,                    -- docker container (null when not running)
  app_port     INTEGER,                 -- reverse-proxied port for the live app (nullable)
  resume_id    TEXT,                    -- harness --resume id (null until first turn)
  transcript   TEXT,                    -- path to harness rollout jsonl (host-mounted)
  status       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',  -- active | done | archived
  frame_state  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'closed',  -- closed | docked | minimized
  speaker      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,      -- per-frame spoken playback toggle
  created_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_active  TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- a surface's "current" session is just a repointable pointer
CREATE TABLE surface_bindings (
  surface      TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'telegram' | 'web'
  external_id  TEXT NOT NULL,           -- telegram chat_id
  session_id   TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sessions(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (surface, external_id)
);

-- per-surface console state that belongs to no single session
CREATE TABLE surface_layout (
  surface           TEXT NOT NULL,
  external_id       TEXT NOT NULL,
  sidebar_collapsed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (surface, external_id)
);
```

Frame layout is a property of the surface, not the browser tab, so it lives
here: each session carries its own `frame_state` and `speaker` preference, and
the sidebar's collapsed state hangs off `surface_layout`. Reopening the console
replays both.

The `resume_id` lives in SQLite, never only in process memory — a restart must be
able to find and resume every session. A `/switch` on any surface just repoints
its `surface_bindings` row, which is the whole fix for "Telegram is stuck on one
session."

## Two views, one table

- **Desktop fan-out.** Click plus, pick a harness and model, get a fresh session.
  Kick off a dozen in parallel; each runs in its own pristine container so they
  never touch each other. When done, archive or delete (container removed).
- **Mobile / Telegram.** List your sessions, resume one, or `/new` to create one.
  The surface binding tracks which session is current; `/switch <id>` repoints it.

Both are UI over the `sessions` table. No separate code path.

## Session lifecycle (control plane)

`agent-server` resolves the surface identity to a `user_id`, resolves (or creates)
the target session, then:

1. **Provision.** `docker run` a pristine container from the base image, mounting
   the user's `memory.db` and `identity.md` read paths and injecting env
   (`user_id`, session `branch`, provider creds). Record `container_id`.
2. **Run harness inside.** `entrypoint.sh` clones the session `branch` from
   `users/<user_id>/origin.git`, then execs the harness — for `claude`:

   ```
   claude -p --output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages \
          [--resume <resume_id>] \
          --append-system-prompt "<identity + memory blocks>"
   ```

   The control plane streams stdout back to the surface, reads the harness session
   id off the first event, writes it to `resume_id`.
3. **Idle / teardown.** Idle containers are stopped (state persists in
   `origin.git`); a resume re-provisions and re-clones. Archiving a session removes
   the container for good; the branch stays.

Concurrency is bounded by a semaphore sized to the box and the provider account.

## HTTP API

Every surface — web console, Telegram bot, curl — speaks only this contract.

```
GET    /health
POST   /users                                   {display_name}
GET    /users
POST   /identities                              {surface, external_id, display_name?} -> {user_id}

POST   /users/{user_id}/sessions                {harness?, model?, title?, color?}
GET    /users/{user_id}/sessions?status=active
GET    /users/{user_id}/frames                  sessions to restore as frames
GET    /sessions/{id}
PATCH  /sessions/{id}                           {title?, color?, status?, frame_state?, speaker?}
DELETE /sessions/{id}

POST   /sessions/{id}/turn                      {prompt} -> ndjson event stream
WS     /sessions/{id}/stream                    send {prompt}, receive events
POST   /sessions/{id}/start                     provision the container
POST   /sessions/{id}/stop                      stop it; state lives in origin.git
POST   /sessions/{id}/archive                   remove the container, keep the branch
GET    /sessions/{id}/diff
GET    /sessions/{id}/clone-url

POST   /surfaces/{surface}/{external_id}/attach {session_id}
GET    /surfaces/{surface}/{external_id}/attach
DELETE /surfaces/{surface}/{external_id}/attach
GET    /surfaces/{surface}/{external_id}/layout
PATCH  /surfaces/{surface}/{external_id}/layout {sidebar_collapsed}

POST   /voice/transcribe                        multipart file -> {text}
POST   /voice/speak                             {text, voice?} -> audio/mpeg
```

Streamed turns are normalised out of each harness's own json into one small
vocabulary, so a surface renders `claude` and `codex` identically:

| kind | payload | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `session` | `resume_id` | first event; persisted to `sessions.resume_id` |
| `text` | `text` | assistant output delta |
| `tool` | `name` | a tool call started |
| `result` | `text` | turn finished |
| `error` | `text` | turn failed |
| `raw` | `event` | unrecognised, passed through |

## Swappable externals

The two pieces that need the VPN sit behind interfaces with offline fakes, so
every layer above them is exercised end to end without a proxy or a Docker
daemon. `FRAME_PROVISIONER` selects `fake` or `docker`; `FRAME_VOICE` selects
`fake` or `azure`. Neither switch changes a call site — see
[docs/vpn-cutover.md](docs/vpn-cutover.md).

## Pull-down and browse

- **Pull to local.** Session work is a branch in `users/<user_id>/origin.git`, so
  `git fetch`/`git clone` from that per-user repo pulls it straight to your laptop.
- **View diffs.** The web surface reads `git diff` for the session branch and
  renders it — no container access needed once the branch is pushed.
- **Drive the live app.** The container exposes the app on `app_port`; the control
  plane reverse-proxies it to a per-session URL, so you click and interact with the
  running app in the browser with zero local setup.

## Web console

The app ships with a web console — the desktop control surface for sessions.

- **Spawn.** A plus button creates a session: pick harness + model, and an **agent
  frame** opens. Fan out many frames at once, tile or focus them.
- **Session sidebar.** A left rail lists the user's sessions (active, with an
  archived view) grouped for scanning; clicking one opens or focuses its frame.
  The rail **collapses** to reclaim width for the grid and its open/collapsed
  state is remembered between visits.
- **The agent frame.** Each frame is one session and **streams by default** — the
  harness output flows live into the frame as an emulated terminal, so you always
  see what the agent is doing without asking. Its main area is the conversation.
  Input is multimodal — type, hold-to-talk voice, image, and drag-and-drop of
  files or folders straight onto the frame, all forwarded to that session's
  harness. A per-frame **speaker toggle** (independent of voice input) turns
  spoken playback of that session's replies on or off, so you can voice a busy
  frame while the rest stay silent; the preference is remembered per session.
- **Sidecar panes.** A frame menu opens panes that expand to the right without
  leaving the conversation:
  - **Browser** — the session's live app, reverse-proxied on its `app_port`, click
    and drive it in place.
  - **Diff** — the session branch's `git diff`, rendered live.
  - **Full terminal (TUI).** Beyond the default read-only stream, a real
    interactive terminal attached to the container (via pty over WebSocket), so you
    can send slash-commands or `$`-commands directly to the harness (e.g. codex
    control commands) and drive raw shell when needed.
- **Frame menu actions.** Per session: rename/title, **recolor** (pick an accent
  color that tints the frame header and the session's list entry so fanned-out
  frames are distinguishable at a glance), archive or delete, `/switch`
  the mobile binding to this session, pull-to-local instructions (the
  `origin.git` branch URL), and **open code** — because the repo is already cloned
  on the host, this launches an editor view (or hands off a local `code <path>`)
  rather than re-cloning. Cloning is only offered when no local copy exists.

The console is pure UI over the existing HTTP API and `sessions` table; it adds no
new session semantics.

### Frame window management

Each frame has a **persistent state** — `docked` (tiled in the grid) or
`minimized` — plus a separate transient **maximized** mode layered on top.

- **Grid.** Docked frames auto-tile; the default tile size is a function of how
  many frames are docked (twelve docked → a twelve-up grid).
- **Minimize.** Sets a frame's persistent state to `minimized` (a strip/tab); the
  remaining docked frames re-tile to fill the space.
- **Restore.** Returns a `minimized` frame to `docked`, rejoining the grid.
- **Maximize.** Promotes one frame to full screen and visually collapses every
  other frame for the duration. This does **not** change the others' persistent
  state — it's an overlay.
- **Un-maximize (restore from maximized).** Every frame returns to its own
  persistent state: docked frames rejoin the grid, and any frame that was already
  `minimized` before the maximize stays minimized. Maximizing then restoring is a
  no-op on the underlying layout.
- **Layout persistence.** The console layout survives a reload or a server
  restart: which sessions are open as frames and each frame's persistent state
  (`docked` / `minimized`), plus the sidebar's collapsed state, are restored on
  return. Because the open set is a property of the surface, not the browser tab,
  it belongs with the session/surface state rather than in client-only storage.

### Mobile web console

The web console is a desktop-first control surface — day-to-day mobile use is the
Telegram surface. When the console *is* opened on a phone, its shell is **locked
to the viewport**: the nav and frame chrome stay fixed and only the conversation
scrolls, so a single frame reads like a chat app instead of the whole page
panning. It collapses to one frame at a time with a back control to the session
list rather than trying to tile a grid on a small screen.

## Telegram surface (engage / disengage)

One bot **per user**, not per agent. A Telegram chat is a thin remote that
*attaches* to one session at a time — this is the trickiest part of the system, so
it's specified explicitly.

- **List.** `/agents` (or a persistent menu button) returns an inline keyboard of
  the user's **active** sessions, one button each labelled by title. `/archived`
  lists archived ones the same way. `/new` creates a session (prompting for
  harness + model) and attaches to it.
- **Engage.** Tapping a session button writes that `session_id` into the chat's
  `surface_bindings` row — the chat is now *attached*. Plain messages (text, voice,
  image) from then on route to that session's harness and its streamed replies come
  back debounced via `editMessageText`. A short header confirms which agent you're
  talking to.
- **Disengage.** `/agents` re-lists without losing the attachment; `/detach`
  clears the binding so the chat is idle again; tapping a different session
  repoints the binding. Exactly one session is attached per chat at a time, so
  there's never ambiguity about where a message goes.
- **State lives in the binding, not the bot.** Because attachment is just the
  `surface_bindings` row, a bot restart or a `/switch` from the web console stays
  consistent — the chat re-attaches to whatever the row says.

## Frequent-commit safety

Two layers, both cheap:

- **`hooks/stop-commit.sh`** — a Stop hook running *inside the container* that does
  `git add -A && git commit && git push origin <branch>` after every turn. Because
  it pushes to the host bare repo, nothing is lost even if the container dies;
  worst case a resumed turn re-does its tail against pushed state.
- **System-prompt discipline** — the agent is told to commit logically as it works
  (durable side effects), so history is meaningful, not one giant blob per turn.

## Voice

Azure Whisper for speech-to-text, an Azure neural voice for text-to-speech,
called inline from the surface or the agent-server. No separate container.

## Deferred (multi-user machinery)

Real auth on the web surface, per-user rate limits/quotas, per-user process
pools, and an onboarding flow for unknown surface identities. The schema already
supports all of it; build when a second user is real.
